# Project 404: This Site Can't Be Reached
This project explores a sample of 45 independent born-digital literary magazines that began publishing at the turn of the 21st century. This is an attempt to begin a longer-term project that will collect, preserve, and document this era of literary publishing in an effort to provide centralized access to readers and researchers. 

The data collected reflects a small pool of examples from the early days of online publishing. Around 1995 literary magazines began to appear in digital incarnations (often refered to contemporaneously as "electronic journals" or "e-zines"). The Mississippi Review Online is credited with being the first such "little magazine" to make the move online, soon followed by the literary magazine hosting site, Web Del Sol and others. The impetus for this project came about because, in recent years, casual web-searches for some of these publications returned "404 not found" notices or strange commercial sites. While some publications, such as DIAGRAM [https://thediagram.com/] and 2 River [https://2river.org/], have continued for decades, many magazines that began publishing in the late 1990s and early-2000s are only avaiable to view via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine [https://web.archive.org/]--an incredible resource, but as any archivist or digital librarian will tell you: saving things in one place is a risky preservation strategy. This prompted some concern and curiosity about what still exists (or doesn't) of this kind of literary magazine. 


# Little Magazines

The tradition of independent, small publishing of magzines, chapbooks and pamphlets is well documented. Little magazines, as they're often refered to, can be defiend as XXXX

Many libraries collect zines and little magazines in analog form, yet none have created similar collections of digital ephemeral publications, though the technology exists to do so. Little magazines have played an important role in many 20th-century literary schools and movements, and continue to do so in both digital and analog formats. Projects such as The Blue Mountain Project [https://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn], a searchable collection of European Avant-Garde magazines, and The Modernist Journals Project [https://modjourn.org/] provide researchers with localized access to digitized little magazines. And while digital little magazines are already on the internet, they are largely dispersed--especially now-historical publications that are no longer producing issues.
