# Project 404: This Site Can't Be Reached
This project explores a sample of 45 independently published born-digital literary magazines that began publishing at the turn of the 21st century. 

The data collected reflects a small pool of examples from the early days of online publishing. Around 1995 literary magazines began to appear in digital incarnations (often refered to contemporaneously as "electronic journals" or "e-zines"). The Mississippi Review Online is credited with being the first such "little magazine" to make the move online, soon followed by the literary magazine hosting site, Web Del Sol and others. The impetus for this project came about because, in recent years, casual web-searches for some of these publications returned "404 not found" notices or strange commercial sites. While some publications, such as DIAGRAM and XXXXX, have continued for decades and are now supported by external funding sources, many magazines that began publishing in the late 1990s and early-2000s are only avaiable to view via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine--an incredible resource, but as any archivist or digital librarian will attest: saving things in one place is a risky preservation strategy. This prompted some concern and curiosity about the existence and non-existence of this pocket of literary publishing that seems, for now, to be an afterthought. 

# Little Magazines

There is a healthy tradition of independent, small publishing of magazines and pamphlets in literary history. They offer outlets for non-mainstream literature to form communities, often fostering experimental and avant-garde schools of writers whose work falls outside commercial productions. Ephemeral publications have existed as long as the printing press

The twentieth century is full of examples. Modernism [show examples and link to Modernism site] and LANGUAGE poetry [examples]
